A Novel Data Compression Algorithm: Enhancing Speed, Energy Efficiency, and Accessibility

Introduction

Data compression is a cornerstone of modern computing, enabling efficient storage and faster transmission of information across networks. Despite advancements in this field, many existing compression algorithms struggle to balance compression ratio, speed, and energy efficiency. In this article, we present a new, innovative approach to data compression that achieves a remarkable compression ratio of 41.06%, as demonstrated in our tests, while maintaining simplicity and high performance. By publishing this work openly, we aim to ensure its accessibility and prevent monopolization of the idea.

Methodology

Our approach leverages a combination of pattern recognition, byte-level optimization, and entropy reduction techniques. Below, we outline the key steps of the algorithm:

Pattern Detection:
The algorithm scans the input data to identify recurring byte patterns.
These patterns are replaced with shorter codes, reducing overall data size.

Dynamic Dictionary Creation:
A dynamic dictionary is built during the compression process to map patterns to codes.
The dictionary is optimized for frequently occurring patterns to maximize efficiency.

Entropy Reduction:
Unnecessary redundancies are eliminated by restructuring the data to minimize randomness.
This step enhances the compressibility of the data without losing fidelity.

Adaptive Encoding:
The algorithm uses adaptive encoding to balance compression and decompression speeds, ensuring real-time performance for applications like robotics and IoT.
